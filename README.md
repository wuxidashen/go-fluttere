# Go Flutter desktop embedder 

A Go (golang) [Custom Flutter Engine
Embedder](https://github.com/flutter/engine/wiki/Custom-Flutter-Engine-Embedders)
for desktop

# Purpose
This project doesn't compete with
[this](https://github.com/google/flutter-desktop-embedding) awesome one.
The purpose of this project is to support the 
[Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) framework on Windows, macOS, and
Linux using a **SINGLE** code base.  

[**GLFW**](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw) fits the job because it
provides the right abstractions over the OpenGL's Buffer/mouse/keyboard for each platform.  

The choice of [Golang](https://github.com/golang/go) comes from the fact that it
has the same tooling on every platform.  
Plus golang is a great language because it keeps everything simple and readable,
which, I hope, will encourage people to contribute :grin:.
